My project is for an outreach that my employer organizes.  The outreach tries to get children (grades 2-5) excited about math and science.  What my website would be is a supplement to the lessons that we do.


CSS features used in my project: 


I have a hamburger menu on my secondary pages.  For the main page the menu switches from a horizontal to a vertical menu.  I have also used flexbox on my website to make the content of the website move to appear better on different screen sizes.  


Javascript features in my project: I have created a contact form.  In this contact form the javascript validates the email address format.  I have also included javascript that does some basic mathematical functions.  The user inputs two numbers, then based on the mathematical operation it will either add, subtract, multiply or divide.
